They are useful as they allow users to type in commands that can produce immediate results or give them the possibility to automate tasks. Some CLI tools: Git, Brew, Curl, etc&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;m a CLI lover as are almost all developers :) The feeling of working with the terminal gives you the sensation to be a Hacker (like the hoodie guy in the movies hidden in the dark and playing with his keyboard)</description></item><item><title>Chapter VI: Esmeralda</title><link>https://yvesdenis.github.io/post/chapter-6/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2017 11:25:05 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yvesdenis.github.io/post/chapter-6/</guid><description>We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public.</description></item><item><title>Chapter V: Quasimodo</title><link>https://yvesdenis.github.io/post/chapter-5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:15:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yvesdenis.github.io/post/chapter-5/</guid><description>In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole’s idea.
