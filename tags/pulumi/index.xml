This workshop which deals with the implementation of a serverless system is a must for all aspiring cloud engineers. It covers both the event-driven approach and the synchronous web-server mechanism.
In this post, we are working to resume the basic concept but bringing a DevOps concept with a pipeline to automate our deployments and also adding a front-end part also deployed in an automated way in the cloud.</description></item></channel></rss>
