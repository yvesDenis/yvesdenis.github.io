This workshop which deals with the implementation of a serverless system is a must for all aspiring cloud engineers. It covers both the event-driven approach and the synchronous web-server mechanism.
In this post, we are working to resume the basic concept but bringing a DevOps concept with a pipeline to automate our deployments and also adding a front-end part also deployed in an automated way in the cloud.</description></item><item><title>Build, deploy and run an application with ECR, ECS and Codebuild (Part 2)</title><link>https://yvesdenis.github.io/post/ecs-ecr-codebuild-part-2-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2022 11:20:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://yvesdenis.github.io/post/ecs-ecr-codebuild-part-2-post/</guid><description>Introduction This is the second part of our project including ECS, ECR, Codebuild, github actions. You can find the first part here.
This part will focus more on the deployment of our application (its container image), the unit tests executed by Codebuild at each push in github and finally we can test through our web browser if our application responds as expected.

Nowadays, the wind of the moment pushes us all to turn to the cloud because in many aspects it offers more advantages compared to on-premises systems.
I decided to divide this tutorial into two parts given its volume, so for this first part, we will focus in more detail on the infrastructure to be deployed and the motivation behind the choice of technologies used.</description></item></channel></rss>
